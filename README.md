### Well hello there 👋

🐓 I'm gallorob, a Junior Researcher in Evolutionary Computation.

🤔 Wonder what I'm up to? Check the latest repositories.

🤔 Wonder why I'm up to something? Check my [💻 blog](https://gallorob.github.io), maybe you'll find the answer there.

🤔 Wonder where/when I'm to up something? Maybe I'll stream on my [🎥 Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/legalleau), who knows.

🤔 Wonder how I'm up to something? ... Does this even make sense anymore? I doubt it 🙄.

Here are some stats. We all love stats, after all:

If it looks like I'm not writing code, it's probably because I'm reading. Or playing [Hnefatafl](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1249510/Hnefatafl/). Probably the latter if it's a weekend 🙃
